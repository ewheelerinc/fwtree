# Firewall configuration written by eWheeler Inc dba Global Linux Security
# The previous line is not just vanity, it enables vim syntax highlight, too ;)

# # Do not modify this file directly.   Create rules in /etc/fwtree.d/.
# #
# # To regenerate firewall rules, perform the following, depending on distribution:
# # CentOS 6 and other SysV distributions:
# # /etc/init.d/fwtree restart
# #
# # CentOS 7 and other Systemd distributions:
# #  systemctl restart fwtree.service
# #
# # Other Distributions:
# #  fwtree | iptables-restore
