# Add this to syslog: kern.=debug     -/var/log/iptables

# # Do not modify this file directly.   Create rules in /etc/iptables.d/.
# #
# # To regenerate firewall rules, perform the following:
# #  /usr/local/bin/fwtree > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
# #
# # Apply the rules:
# #  /usr/local/bin/fwtree | iptables-restore
# #
# # or
# #  /etc/init.d/iptables restart
