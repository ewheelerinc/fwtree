# Firewall configuration written by eWheeler Inc dba Global Linux Security
# The previous line is not just vanity, it enables vim syntax highlight, too ;)

# Add this to syslog: kern.=debug     -/var/log/iptables

# # Do not modify this file directly.   Create rules in /etc/iptables.d/.
# #
# # To regenerate firewall rules, perform the following, depending on distribution:
# # CentOS 6:
# #  fwtree > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
# #
# # and then
# #  /etc/init.d/iptables restart
# #
# # CentOS 7:
# #  systemctl restart fwtree.service
# #
# # Other Distributions:
# #  fwtree | iptables-restore
#
